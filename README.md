## Overview

The SPARCS dataset contains comprehensive information about hospital discharges in New York State, including patient demographics, clinical details, and outcomes. This project aims to analyze the dataset using machine learning to uncover patterns and trends that can inform healthcare policy and improve patient care.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the SPARCS dataset to make it suitable for machine learning analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and key features through visualization and summary statistics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Apply various machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes such as length of stay, readmission rates, and discharge status.
- **Feature Importance**: Identify the most significant factors influencing patient outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Dataset

The SPARCS dataset includes information on:

- **Patient Information**: Age, gender, race, ethnicity, and zip code.
- **Hospital Information**: Hospital identifier, name, and location.
- **Admission Details**: Admission type, source, and date.
- **Clinical Information**: Diagnoses, procedures, and comorbidities.
- **Outcome Information**: Length of stay, discharge status, and readmission.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Data visualization

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sparcs-ml-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To analyze the SPARCS dataset using machine learning, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean and preprocess the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use the `eda.ipynb` notebook to perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the data.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Run the `model_training.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate machine learning models on the dataset.

4. **Feature Importance**: Use the `feature_importance.ipynb` notebook to analyze the importance of different features in predicting patient outcomes.
